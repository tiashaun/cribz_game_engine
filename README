This is my first Game and My first real C++ project.

This is an incomplete game engine tht uses SDL as the graphics libary.

There are some bugs at the moment.

Bugs:
	Can use upto a Gigabyte of memory:
		Probably Due to it being Incomplete
		OR 
		Some huge Memory Leaks

	Screen Blank:
		This after a while will take over
		the screen and wont render the background and the player.

	Player Movement:
		No real bugs here it just lags a bit.
		No support for holding down keys.


Missing:
	Game States
	Fps implimentation
	Physics
	Proper player movement
	solid ground
	etc.
